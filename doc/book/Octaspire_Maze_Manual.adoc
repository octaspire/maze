Octaspire Maze is a puzzle game written in *Octaspire Dern* programming language with
some standard C99. It uses *Octaspire Core* and *SDL2* libraries. It should run on all
platforms that have SDL2 available, even on slower hardware - it is developed
from the start in Raspberry Pi 2.

Maze uses
http://semver.org[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] version numbering scheme.
As long as the MAJOR version number is zero anything can change at any time,
even in backwards incompatible manner.

== Building the amalgamated source release

The amalgamated source release is the recommended way of using Maze, if you don't need to
modify Maze itself. To use the amalgamated release, you will need only a C compiler,
C standard library supporting C99 and the SDL2 library.

=== Linux, Haiku, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, MINIX 3, OpenIndiana, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD and MidnightBSD
