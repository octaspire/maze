This is amalgamated single file source release for Octaspire Maze puzzle game
version 0.83.2. File 'octaspire-maze-amalgamated.c'
is all that is needed; it has no other dependencies than a C compiler and
standard library supporting C99 and SDL2 library.

Building instructions for all supported platforms (and scripts for building
automatically) can be found in directory 'how-to-build'. Look for a file that
has your platform's name in the file's name. If instructions for your
platform are not yet added, looking instructions for a similar system will
probably help. The amalgamation contains only one source file and should be
straightforward to use. By using few compiler defines, the single file can
be used for different purposes:

	(1) to build stand-alone unit test runner for the file.
	(2) to build the game.

Octaspire Maze is work in progress. The most recent version
